<!--Can display footer as flex and then justify the content with space between to spread them out-->
    <footer>
        <!--a is an inline element so we'll use display:block in css to make it a block level element-->
        <a href="#Previous" class="button">Previous</a>
        <!--No need to add a class to the p tag because its the only one in the footer so we can just style all p tags within -->
        <p>My Name</p>
        <!--Has the same class as the other button so will share one block off css-->
        <a href="#Next" class="button">Next</a>
    </footer>
