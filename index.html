        You can always count on me to be there to support you... <br>
        Unless of course there is something more exciting for me to do!
    </h4>
    <p>
        Jokes aside, you can always count on me to help out, assuming there are things that I know and you don't.<br>
        Also I like to think I'm a funny guy but I'll leave that for you to decide
    </p>

    <h5>
        Here's a funny story about my life: I taught my cousin how to protect herself...<br>
        She ended up kicking me between my legs every time she was angry at me!<br>
        Isn't that lovely?
